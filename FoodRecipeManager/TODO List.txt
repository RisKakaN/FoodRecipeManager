TODO:
Prioritized fixes needed:

- Improve card design.

- Require double password entry for cases like change password, and sign up.

- Implement profile picture. A round picture?

- Implement custom spinners, in order to improve the layout, such as removing unnecessary padding, or maybe adding icons, etc.

- Make it possible to edit an ingredient's amount while viewing it (NOT EDIT MODE).
  In this way, if you only have 900g flour, you can make the rest of the ingredients proportional to your "900g of flour",
  instead of proportional to the portions. So, make it possible to edit the amount while viewing it.
  And this should not save it. Saving is done through editing the recipe.

Functionality to add:
X. Improve how instructions are being added and visualized. Introduce steps.
   Each step is one box of information, and so on.
X. Implement Favorite. OR rating?
   Involves implementing a Favorite tab. Or Filter functionality.
X. Add favorites tab. OR rating? Mark recipe as favorite.
X. Add filter functionality.
X. Show loading animation while loading Firebase data.
X. Remember email for login for the last user.

Performance improvement:
X. Look into: "I/Choreographer: Skipped 62 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread."
X. Handle loading all tabs at start better.

Firebase improvements:
X. Improve how recipes are saved. Currently, the entire list is saved/loaded for every save/load.
   Only the saved/loaded recipe should be involved in a save/load.


Design:

Other sections of the app, Tbd1:
- Shopping list? What you have at home list?
- Available ingredients at home, and recommend recipes for you?
