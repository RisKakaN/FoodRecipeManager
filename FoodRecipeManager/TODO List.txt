TODO:
Prioritized fixes needed:

- Add portions and make it adjustable. e.g. incrementing portions will increment ingredients accordingly.
  (MAYBE also possibility to alter the amount of one ingredient, and the rest should change to be proportional.)

- Improve card design.

- Require double password entry for cases like change password, and sign up.

- Implement profile picture. A round picture?

Functionality to add:
X. Improve how instructions are being added and visualized. Introduce steps.
   Each step is one box of information, and so on.
X. Implement Favorite. OR rating?
   Involves implementing a Favorite tab. Or Filter functionality.
X. Add favorites tab. OR rating? Mark recipe as favorite.
X. Add filter functionality.
X. Show loading animation while loading Firebase data.

Performance improvement:
X. Look into: "I/Choreographer: Skipped 62 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread."
X. Handle loading all tabs at start better.

Firebase improvements:
X. Improve how recipes are saved. Currently, the entire list is saved/loaded for every save/load.
   Only the saved/loaded recipe should be involved in a save/load.


Design:

Other sections of the app, Tbd1:
- Shopping list? What you have at home list?
- Available ingredients at home, and recommend recipes for you?
